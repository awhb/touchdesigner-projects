An environment rendered using Unreal Engine having lighting properties vary with OSC-based signals from a TouchDesigner project.

The environment is inside a subway, currently lights are both randomised as well as pulsing in intensity.

## LavaRand

A project inspired by Cloudflare's use of lava lamps to create secure encryption keys. 

Uses continuously updating typography as well as interactive elements based on colours/shapes in a lava lamp.

## Butterfly Effect

![Particle Art](ButterflyEffect/ButterflyEffect_ss.png)

A visualisation through animated particles of an image generated by Refik Anadolâ€™s open source Large Nature Model.

Said generated picture is of a butterfly, with ripple effects added to bring to mind the butterfly effect.

## 3D Stained Glass

![Stained Glass](3DStainedGlass/3dstainedglass_ss.png)

A 3D rendering of a 2D stained glass design through determining normal and height maps. Here I used DeepBump, a Blender add-in to generate these maps.

Subject is of a garden with flowers and birds, which I chose for variety in colour and texture.
